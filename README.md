# Wolf of Wall Street: A Data-Driven Stock Market Analysis (2016–2024)

### End-to-End SQL + Python + Tableau Project

This project explores nine years of U.S. stock market performance (2016–2024) across **14 leading companies in top-performing sectors**.  
The goal was to uncover which stocks delivered the best long-term returns, which sectors consistently outperformed, and how volatility (risk) shaped investment outcomes — all from the perspective of a **new investor** deciding where to put their money.

Using **PostgreSQL**, **Python**, and **Tableau**, I transformed raw price data into an interactive story that visualizes growth trends, sector performance, and risk-adjusted returns.

## Query Summaries

Each SQL script produced a unique dataset that contributed to the full Tableau story.

| # | Query | 
|---|--------|
| **1️ Top Performing Stocks** | Ranked total returns (2016–2024). TSLA led the decade. |
| **2️ Year-over-Year Growth** | Measured annual price growth. Tech and Financials showed the strongest YoY momentum; Healthcare maintained steady gains. |
| **3️ Volatility Index** | Calculated yearly price fluctuation. JNJ was the most stable, TSLA the most volatile. |
| **4️ Moving Averages** | Compared 50-day vs 200-day trends to classify momentum as Bullish or Bearish. |
| **5️ Sector Performance** | Aggregated returns by sector. Financials led, followed by Healthcare. |
| **6 Simulated $10K Portfolio** | Modeled a $10K investment per stock since 2016 — TSLA yielded the highest growth. |

## Year-Over-Year (YoY) Trend Analysis

This analysis tracked each stock’s average yearly growth to identify consistent compounders versus volatile performers.

**Highlights:**
- **Consumer Discretionary and Financials** had the most persistent upward momentum.  
- **TSLA** surged in 2020–2021 but faced post-rally volatility.  
- **Healthcare & Tech** (comapanies like **MSFT** and **JPM**) showed slower but steady gains.  

YoY trends revealed which stocks built sustainable value over time — not just short-term spikes.
